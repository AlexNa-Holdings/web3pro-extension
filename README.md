# Web3Pro Cypto Wallet Extension

This is a crypto wallet that I use for my personal use. It is a selfware project. It is not intended for mass consumption

It is based on the Frame extension: https://github.com/floating/frame-extension, 
but heavily modified and improved for the Web3Pro wallet


# SELFWARE

- **SelfWare**: Software made for myself, shared openly.

- **Not a Product**: Never intended for mass consumption or to meet market needs.

- **Developer-Driven**: Built exactly the way the developer envisions—no compromises, no community influence.

- **Open Source**: Open for anyone to use, modify, or adapt as they see fit, while staying true to the developer's original vision.

- **Independence**: No roadmaps driven by user feedback, no polls, no votes—only the developer's decisions.

- **A Personal Tool**: Solves specific problems for the creator, rather than catering to a broad user base.
